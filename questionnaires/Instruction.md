## Instructions for Video Level Self-assessment

Thank you for participating in our study. In this stage, for each short video, you will be rated based on your subjective experience while interacting with it. Please note that your ratings will be used in the study.

The self-assessment includes the following four labels: valence, arousal, immersion, and satisfaction. A 5-point Likert scale was used, ranging from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Particularlyï¼Œvalence and arousal are two-dimesions of mood, which come from ![Thayer mood model](mood_model.png).
