## Questionnaires

"questionnaires/qustionnaires.pdf" shows the survey, the session immersion scale, and the satisfaction scale.

"questionnaires/instruction.md" is the instruction for video-level self-assessment in the lab study. 

## Data

### labels

The data is organized in the form of dictionary

Path = "./data/metadata/{uid}_behavior_MAES.json"

For each interaction(uid,iid), fields:

"start_time", "end_time": the start and end time of viewing the video (timestamp)
"eeg_start_time", "eeg_end_time": the EEG time aligned with start and end time
"like", "like_time": like or not; if like, the timestamp of liking
"video_duration": duration of the video (in seconds)
"immersion", "satisif", "valence", "arousal": rating from 1-5
"session_id", "video_order": the order of session and video, specifically
"video_tag": encoded video tag
"session_mode": personalized / randomized / non-personalized / mixed

### EEG data

### partcipants

The basic information of the participants

Path = "./data/participant.csv"

Fields: iid, age, gender, usage (using year of short video app we employed, 1: never, 2:under 6 months, 3: 6-12 months, 4: 1-2 years, 5: over 2 years)

### Video features

The features of the videos

Path = "./data/video_features/video_features.csv", "./data/video_features/video_ComParE-example.csv"


## Codes
